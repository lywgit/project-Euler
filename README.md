# Project E u l e r


Thinking of playing [project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) at leisure as a kind of exercise. Probably won't go far, but why not?

For my own convenience, I am using this repository to save my code (backup). But note in principle, one shouldn't post solutions outside the site forum.
